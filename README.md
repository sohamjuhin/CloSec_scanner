## CloSec_scanner
Cloud Security  vulnerability scanner
# This code will first get information about the cloud account, such as the account ID, name, and region. It will then get a list of all cloud resources for the account, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and RDS databases. Finally, it will scan the cloud resources for known vulnerabilities.


# The code can then be used to identify any cloud resources that are vulnerable to known security threats. This information can then be used to take steps to mitigate the vulnerabilities and protect the cloud account from attack.

# To run the code, you will need to install the requests and json Python libraries. You can then run the code by saving it as a Python file and then running the file from the command line. For example, if the file is named 
 # CloSec_scanner.py  you would run it by typing the following command into the command line:


 python  CloSec_scanner.py
